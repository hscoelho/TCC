  abstract = { This article presents GraphSLAM, a unifying algorithm for the offline SLAM problem. GraphSLAM is closely related to a recent sequence of research papers on applying optimization techniques to SLAM problems. It transforms the SLAM posterior into a graphical network, representing the log-likelihood of the data. It then reduces this graph using variable elimination techniques, arriving at a lower-dimensional problems that is then solved using conventional optimization techniques. As a result, GraphSLAM can generate maps with 108 or more features. The paper discusses a greedy algorithm for data association, and presents results for SLAM in urban environments with occasional GPS measurements. }

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.}},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review on sensor modalities currently in used for solving the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. The review focuses on SLAM for mobile robots in a variety of environments. The strengths and weaknesses of acoustic modality sensors such as ultrasonic and sonar sensors, laser range finders, visual sensors such as stereo vision sensors, and RGB-D sensors like the Microsoft Kinect and the Asus Xtion Pro Live are compared based on current usage in published research papers. Based on this review, we propose that RGB-D sensors have unique advantages which make them particularly suitable for SLAM problems.}

  abstract = {The spatio-temporal voxel grid is an actively maintained open-source project providing an improved three-dimensional environmental representation that has been garnering increased adoption in large, dynamic, and complex environments. We provide a voxel grid and the Costmap 2-D layer plug-in, Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer, powered by a real-time sparse occupancy grid with constant time access to voxels which does not scale with the environment’s size. We replace ray-casting with a new clearing technique we dub frustum acceleration that does not assume a static environment and in practice, represents moving environments better. Our method operates at nearly 400\% less CPU load on average while processing 9 QVGA resolution depth cameras as compared to the voxel layer. This technique also supports sensors such as three-dimensional laser scanners, radars, and additional modern sensors that were previously unsupported in the available ROS Navigation framework that has become staples in the roboticists’ toolbox. These sensors are becoming more widely used in robotics as sensor prices are driven down and mobile compute capabilities improve. The Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer was developed in the open with community feedback over its development life cycle and continues to have additional features and capabilities added by the community. As of February 2019, the Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer is being used on over 600 robots worldwide in warehouses, factories, hospitals, hotels, stores, and libraries. The open-source software can be viewed and installed on its GitHub page at https://github.com/SteveMacenski/spatio\_temporal\_voxel\_layer.}
